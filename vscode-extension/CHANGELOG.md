All notable changes to the Llamit extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Smart Git Diff with Fallback**: Extension now automatically handles both staged and unstaged changes
  - If staged changes exist, uses only those (maintains original behavior)
  - If no staged changes, automatically falls back to working directory changes
  - Prioritizes staged changes when both staged and unstaged changes are present
  - No longer requires manual staging before generating commit messages

### Changed
- Updated message from "No staged changes to commit" to "No changes to commit" for better clarity
- Enhanced `getGitDiffCascade()` function with intelligent diff selection logic

### Internal
- Added `executeGitDiff()` helper function for better code organization
- Deprecated `getGitDiff()` in favor of `getGitDiffCascade()` (backward compatible)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for cascade logic

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-05

  ### Fixed
  - CI/CD pipeline with Node.js 20 compatibility
  - GitHub Actions permissions for automatic releases

  ### Added
  - Automated publishing to Open VSX and VS Code Marketplace
  
## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Platform-Specific Packaging**: Extension now distributed as separate packages for each platform
- Support for Windows ARM64 architecture
- Automated packaging scripts (`npm run package:all`, `npm run publish:all`)
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
- Platform-specific build optimization with `VSCE_TARGET` environment variable

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Distribution method changed from universal package to platform-specific packages
- Each platform now gets a dedicated `.vsix` file (win32-x64, win32-arm64, linux-x64, linux-arm64, darwin-x64, darwin-arm64)
- VS Code automatically selects the correct package for user's platform
- Improved build script to support targeted platform compilation

### Technical Details
- Package size: ~16.5 MB per platform (includes all binaries due to vsce limitations)
- Runtime platform detection remains unchanged and fully functional
- All 6 platforms supported: Windows (x64, ARM64), Linux (x64, ARM64), macOS (Intel, Apple Silicon)
- Follows VS Code's recommended distribution pattern for native binaries

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-04

### Added
- **Configurable Formats**: Support for 6 predefined styles (Conventional, Angular, Gitmoji, Karma, Semantic, Google)
- **Custom Format Templates**: New setting `llamit.customFormat` for user-defined prompts
- **Advanced Post-processing**: Automated stripping of markdown backticks and artifacts from LLM output
- **Optimized Prompts**: Enhanced system instructions for precise, one-line commit messages
- **Marketplace Branding**: High-fidelity badges, refreshed logo, and professional description

### Changed
- Integrated Go CLI build process into extension packaging (`npm run package`)
- Improved retry logic for better resilience against transient Ollama errors
- Updated extension settings with descriptive enums and multi-line custom editor

### Fixed
- Outdated binary builds in extension packages
- Marker artifacts (```) appearing in commit messages
- Extension ID mapping in integration tests
